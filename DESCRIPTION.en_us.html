<p>Inspired by lettering seen on the posters Oscar M. Bryn made for the Santa Fe Railroad, Calistoga is a cheerful display face whose style that remains the flavor of fancy yet comfortable Railroads trips and the West of the United States.

<p>Calistoga is a semi condensed saving space display typeface of a strong and kind personality displayed also in its wide sets of figures that range from proportional linning to tabular Old Style, as well as a variety of fractions.</p>
        
<p>Its vintage Railroad flavor goes until its symbols, currency, and punctuation which also includes also case sensitive forms.</p>
        
<p>Calistoga is an original typeface designed by Yvonne Schuttler. Eben Sorkin expanded the language support and refined the design in 2018.</p>
